# Fork of https://github.com/docker-library/python

## Fork with Debug information on: [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/luizfelipestangarlin/docker-python-debug/)


This is a fork of the Git repo of the [Docker "Official Image"](https://github.com/docker-library/official-images#what-are-official-images) for [`python`](https://hub.docker.com/_/python/) (not to be confused with any official `python` image provided by `python` upstream). See [the Docker Hub page](https://hub.docker.com/_/python/) for the full readme on how to use this Docker image and for information regarding contributing and issues.

The [full image description on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/_/python/) is generated/maintained over in [the docker-library/docs repository](https://github.com/docker-library/docs), specifically in [the `python` directory](https://github.com/docker-library/docs/tree/master/python).

## See a change merged here that doesn't show up on Docker Hub yet?

Too bad, merges are manual, make a PR.
